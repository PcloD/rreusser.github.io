This page contains a gallery of multi-scale [Turing patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_pattern). The method is a single-variable simulation of a [reaction-diffusion system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction%E2%80%93diffusion_system) which approximates diffusion through circular convolutions. The multi-scale extension switches between Turing patterns at different scales based on local properties. The images below implement Jason Rampe's blog post [Multi-Scale Turing Patterns](https://softologyblog.wordpress.com/2011/07/05/multi-scale-turing-patterns/) in which he describes with excellent clarity the algorithm previously described by [Jonathan McCabe](http://www.jonathanmccabe.com/) in his paper, [Cyclic Symmetric Multi-Scale Turing Patterns](http://www.jonathanmccabe.com/Cyclic_Symmetric_Multi-Scale_Turing_Patterns.pdf). (Both an indepespensible read if you want to explore these patterns further!)

You can view a live implementation with which the images on this page were computed [here](http://rreusser.github.io/multiscale-turing-patterns/), and you can find the source of the implementation [here](https://github.com/rreusser/rreusser.github.io/tree/a3ee324f82794e7be632038fd218ca38ae91d27b/src/src/multiscale-turing-patterns). The simulation is computed in WebGL using the (outstanding!) [regl](https://github.com/regl-project/regl) library. (I love regl, but that's a topic for [another post](http://rreusser.github.io/from-nothing-to-something-in-webgl-with-regl/)).  The implementation is not currently configurable on the web‚Äîthough I would love for it to be!

Most of the images below are computed at 4096 x 4096 pixels, which is the limit of the size my poor laptop can manage before the system grinds to a halt. Each image takes 10-20 minutes to compute. Using periodicity, they're extended horizontally to 6144 pixels wide so that they fit on a horizontal screen.  For the convolutions, it uses my own [GLSL implementation](https://github.com/rreusser/glsl-fft) of the Fast Fourier Transform, which is in turn a refactoring of [David Li's FFT implementation](http://david.li/filtering/). I found when trying out parameters that very slightly negative weights produce a wonderful effect in coloring detail (as seen in the first two images).

Based on my approach to coloring, I'm thrilled that Jason has also tried it out and since added coloring to his method and blog post. I heartily second his encouragement to try things out, let people know when their work is helpful, and seek out collaboration! üéâ

(Realistically, shoot me a message at [@rickyreusser](https://twitter.com/rickyreusser) and I'd probably let you do just about anything with these images, but I've made the high resolution originals available out of good will and good intentions, and since I'm deeply indebted to the people whose work has enabled me to create these, I've licensed these explicitly only as a small step beyond simply asking politely that you not, like, turn around and sell them for profit or something. ‚ù§Ô∏è)
