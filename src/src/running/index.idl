### 3/26/18

4.75 miles. Untimed.

### 3/25/18

11 mile hike.

### 3/23/18

4.75 miles. Untimed. Achilles pain subsided a bit after two miles.


### 3/21/18

4.75 miles. Untimed. I'm still in alright shape, but I haven't run in a couple weeks and I haven't done a structured workout in months. I decided on three goals this morning:

1. Local marathon in late-March 2019.
2. Sub-50 minutes for 10 miles
3. Log workouts

So here we are.
